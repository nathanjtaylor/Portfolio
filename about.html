      <h1><strong>About</strong></h1>
      <p>I grew up in Northville, Michigan and am currently a junior at Michigan State University pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Information Science with a focus on human-centered design, and minors in Computer Science, Information Technology and Data Visualization. I am deeply passionate about making a positive impact on others' lives, which has been a driving force throughout my personal and professional journey. This desire to help is what drew me to the world of Information Technology(IT) and User Experience(UX). Beyond the digital realm, I've also translated this passion for aiding others into leadership roles. As the President of MSU's Tabletop Club, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to help foster a communal social environment for fellow students. This club not only provides a platform for relaxation and unwinding but also has allowed us to contribute to a thriving campus community. In my free time, I enjoy playing saxophone, creative writing, and going on long walks.
